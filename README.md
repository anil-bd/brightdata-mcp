## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the official Bright Data Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling LLMs, agents and apps to access, discover and extract web data in real-time. This server allows MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf and others, to seamlessly search the web, navigate websites, take action and retrieve data - without getting blocked - perfect for scraping tasks.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Web Access**: Access up-to-date information directly from the web
- **Bypass Geo-restrictions**: Access content regardless of location constraints
- **Web Unlocker**: Navigate websites with bot detection protection
- **Browser Control**: Optional remote browser automation capabilities
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with all MCP-compatible AI assistants

## 🚀 Quickstart with Claude Desktop

1. Install `nodejs` to get the `npx` command (node.js module runner). Installation instructions can be found on the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "<insert-your-api-token-here>",
        "WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE": "<optional if you want to override the default mcp_unlocker zone name>",
        "BROWSER_AUTH": "<optional if you want to enable remote browser control tools>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## 🔧 Available Tools

[List of Available Tools](https://github.com/brightdata-com/brightdata-mcp/blob/main/assets/Tools.md)

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

**Important:** Always treat scraped web content as untrusted data. Never use raw scraped content directly in LLM prompts to avoid potential prompt injection risks. 
Instead:
- Filter and validate all web data before processing
- Use structured data extraction rather than raw text (web_data tools)

## 🔧 Account Setup

1. Make sure you have an account on [brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com) (new users get free credit for testing, and pay as you go options are available)

2. Get your API key from the [user settings page](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users)

3. (Optional) Create a custom Web Unlocker zone 
   - By default, we create a Web Unlocker zone automatically using your API token
   - For more control, you can create your own Web Unlocker zone in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) and specify it with the `WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE` environment variable

4. (Optional) To enable browser control tools:
   - Visit your Bright Data control panel at [brightdata.com/cp/zones](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones)
   - Create a new 'Browser API' zone
   - Once created, copy the authentication string from the Browser API overview tab
   - The authentication string will be formatted like: `brd-customer-[your-customer-ID]-zone-[your-zone-ID]:[your-password]`

## 🔌 Other MCP Clients

To use this MCP server with other agent types, you should adapt the following to your specific software:

- The full command to run the MCP server is `npx @brightdata/mcp`
- The environment variable `API_TOKEN=<your-token>` must exist when running the server

## 💡 Usage Examples

Some example queries that this MCP server will be able to help with:

- "Google some movies that are releasing soon in [your area]"
- "What's Tesla's current market cap?"
- "What's the Wikipedia article of the day?"
- "What's the 7-day weather forecast in [your location]?"
- "Of the 3 highest paid tech CEOs, how long have their careers been?"

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Timeouts when using certain tools

Some tools can involve reading web data, and the amount of time needed to load the page can vary by quite a lot in extreme circumstances.

To ensure that your agent will be able to consume the data, set a high enough timeout in your agent settings.

A value of `180s` should be enough for 99% of requests, but some sites load slower than others, so tune this to your needs.

### spawn npx ENOENT

This error occurs when your system cannot find the `npx` command. To fix it:

#### Finding npm/Node Path

**macOS:**

```
which node
```

Shows path like `/usr/local/bin/node`

**Windows:**

```
where node
```

Shows path like `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`

#### Update your MCP configuration:

Replace the `npx` command with the full path to Node, for example, on mac, it will look as follows:

```
"command": "/usr/local/bin/node"
```
